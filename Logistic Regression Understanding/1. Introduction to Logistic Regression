This is the Notes and Code for the Logistic Regression.

Here, we have just learned about the Logistic Regression and Cost function:

  Logistic regression is made up of Simple Regression and Sigmoid function that is the
  main reason we called this as Logistic Regression.

L2 Regularisation is used to reduce the Overfitting.

We are learning something in the Logistic Regression.


Checking the Accuracy of the Model.

DATASET : Imbalanced DATASET.

in case of imbalanced DATASET we have to use different technique thatis precision.

TP/TP+FP

Out of actual values how many are correctly predicted.

We are considering the Recall,
